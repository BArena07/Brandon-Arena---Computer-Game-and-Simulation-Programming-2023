Hello, I'm Brandon Arena

This is my game called X-Word for the Computer Game and Simulation Programming event.

I used the Unity Game Engine with the programming language C#

It is a crossword puzzle game with simple controls, you simply click to interact(you can find a more in depth tutorial in the game)

To launch the game simply download and extract the "X-Word" folder and run the file called "Brandon Arena - State Project"

If you want to look at the source code, download the folder "Source Code"

I hope you have fun!
